# Project Donkey Audit

A personal project to practice the handling of APIs. Use the publically available UK parliament API to return data regarding specific MPs through a static web page.

# Inspiration

- [Led by Donkeys]() are a fantastic organisation that deserve far more attention and influence than they receive. I beleive in greater transparency and accountability for elected officals and Governments. I fell that the imagined product would not be out of place as part of a similar instituition's website.
- Similar sites/services exist, such as [TheyWorkForYou]() and the [UK Parliament site](), but are they difficult to use and not well known.
- I would like to produce a very simple website which displays multiple items from the [UK Parliament Member API]() for a specified MP.
- This information would be presented clearly with a short section on how to critically appraise the information.

#
# Outline

- Return information on MPs based on a search.
    - MP name (this can be handled with the API)
    - Post Code (this may require an additional step to convert postcode to constituencyId for the API)

- Present the returned information clearly, with an about page that will assist the user with how to interpret the information and clearly state the owner/developer of this site along with their intention.

- Simple Aesthetic = Newspaper.
