            <h1>How to use this tool and interpret the information</h1>
            <p>The Sleuth & Donkey allows you to search for an MP and view their publically available information through the UK Parliament Members API. Currently, you can only search by MP name. In future, you will be able to search by entering your postcode to in order to find the MP for your area without needing to know their name.</p>
            <h2>The information</h2>
            <ol class="how-to">
                <li>
                    <p>Name, Portait and Bio</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This bio is written (and the portrait provided) <strong>by the MP</strong> and taken from UK Parliament data.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Register of Intersts</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are interests declared <strong>by the MP</strong> according to UK Parliament data.</li>
                        <li>MPs and Lords must delcare these interests publically. They should be compared against their voting records and statements for signs of influence or bias.</li>
                        <li>From time-to-time you might see MPs or Lords in the News beacause of a conflict of interest. This is an area desperately in need of greater transparency. There are many ways of not declaring things, and many things that do need to be to be declared (which probably should be).</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Voting Record</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>These are the votes this MP has recorded in the House.</li>
                        <li>They should be conisdered in light of the MP's declared (and undeclared) interests, and in the context of the time the votes took place.</li>
                        <li>Particular attention should be paid when an MP votes <strong>against</strong> the direction of their party.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Last Election</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is the result of the last election for this MP's constituency.</li>
                        <li>Large majorities make for safe seats, since large voting changes are needed to change MP.</li>
                        <li>Small majorities can make for temptiong targets for opposition MPs. These constiuencies are often the ones-to-watch on election nights.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Contact Information</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This contact information is provided <strong>by the MP</strong> for the purposes of corresponding with voters and constituents. It is publically available from UK Parliament data.</li>
                        <li>You've probably heard of people "writing to their MP" and MPs themselves referring to letter and emails from constituents. It is actually a very effective way of the electorate exerting their influence on elected officials.</li>
                        <li>We encourage you to contact your MP about issues you feel strongly about, particularly when it comes to holding them to account for their actions in-and-out of Parliament.</li>
                        <li>MPs get the message when an issue generates significant correspondence for their in-trays.</li>
                        <li>Everyone should particpate in democracy; by <strong>eloquently making their case to their MP</strong> and <strong>voting</strong> according to their desired outcome for society.</li>
                        <li><strong>Abuse and threats do not achieve anything</strong> (and are quite possibly/literally <strong>illegal</strong>). If you want to be heard, you are best being clear, concise . . . and orgainsed; <strong>speak together because numbers matter.</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h1>Who made this & Why?</h1>
            <p>This tool and site was created as a coding exercise by one person - <a href="https://github.com/ProfYaffle88/donkey-audit">Prof Yaffle</a>.</p>
            <p>This project was heavily inspored by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LedByDonkeys"></a>Led By Donkeys and the author's fervent desire for greater transparency and accountability in Government.</p>
            <p>It does not seek to influence, skew or manipulate. All data is presented, unmodified, as it is retrieved from UK Parliament records.</p>
            <p>In using this tool, it is hoped that the people using it will become more actively engaged in politics. The more people that participate in democracy, the more likely we are to see significant change.</p>
            <p>If you object to any of the information that you read after searching for an MP, you should <Strong>politely</Strong> contact that MP using the contact details that they have kindly provided for that purpose.</p>
